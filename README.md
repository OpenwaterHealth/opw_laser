## Getting Started
The noninvasive, real-time bloodflow monitoring system at Openwater employs the phase-wave laser speckle contrast imaging technique.
This imaging approach requires an illumination system (laser) and the detection system (camera). A speckle pattern comprises random bright and dark spots that arise due to the interference of multiple backscatterd light from scattering medium (biological tissue). The quality of speckle image depends on the coherence and the stablility of the laser used in the system. Therefore, the test protocol for the coherence and the stability is explained in details in these documents.


## files located in repo:

* Laser spatial mode test procedure - This document explains the procedure to run the transverse mode test for the laser during pulsing.

* Interferometric characterization - This test is performed to realize the frequency stability or perseverance of the linewidth during the pulse.

* Speckle contrast measurements - This provides the final test procedure performed on the laser system with direct speckle contrast measruements to qualify the laser.

## Prerequisites

Various sensitive optical equipment are needed to build the blood flow device and evaulate the quality of the laser illumination required. See repo for test and calibration equipment and procedure.
