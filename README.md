# Introduction
The noninvasive, real-time bloodflow monitoring system at Openwater employs the laser speckle contrast imaging technique.
This imaging approach requires an illumination system (laser) and the detection system (camera). A speckle pattern comprises random bright and dark spots that arise due to the interference of multiple backscatterd light from scattering medium (biological tissue). The quality of speckle image depends on the coherence and the stablility of the laser used in the system. Therefore, the laser system is tested for the coherence and the stability explained in details in the documents mentioned belwo.

* Laser characterization and qualification-
This document describes testing of the lasers used in Openwater systems. It begins with a short overview of important background topics including coherence length and chirp. It then describes the specific tests used to qualify our lasers, namely

a) Laser spatial mode test - This document explains the procedure to run the transverse mode test for the laser during pulsing

b) Interferometric characterization to realize the frequency stability or perseverance of the linewidth during the pulse - This document gives the detail information on the characterization of the laser for its coherence and the stability

c) Speckle contrast measurements - This provides the final test procedure performed on the laser system with direct speckle contrast measruements to qualify the laser
